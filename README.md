# snippetsForNVDA
This repository contains experimental code I'm developing for the NVDA screen reader

## How to use this code?
In the `advanced` category of the NVDA preferences dialog, you need to check
the two check boxes corresponding to  enable the developer options and to enable
the scratchpad directory.
When you do this, the folder structure will be created on your computer and you
can copy the scripts provided here to your scratchpad folder to test them.
